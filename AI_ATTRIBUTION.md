# AI Attribution Tracking

This document tracks which AI models generated or contributed to which parts of the Revvel Email Organizer codebase. The user requested transparency about AI involvement in code generation.

## Architecture & Code Generation

| **Database Schema** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Schema design | 8 tables: users, gmail_accounts, subscriptions, user_settings, email_categories, commitments, contacts, ai_attribution |
| **tRPC Routers** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | API design | Auth, Gmail, Subscription, Settings, Commitments, Contacts, AI, Compass |
| **OpenRouter Integration** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Service implementation | Routes AI requests through Claude Sonnet 4.5 for email analysis |
| **Gmail OAuth Service** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | OAuth flow, API integration | Real Gmail API with demo mode fallback |
| **Compass Dashboard** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | UI/UX design & implementation | Inbox Weather, Relational Sonar, Commitment Tracker, Energy Matching, Decision Fatigue Guard |
| **Accessibility System** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Accessibility architecture | ECO CODE, NEURO CODE, DYSLEXIC MODE with OpenDyslexic font |
| **Theme System** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Design system | Earthy dark theme, glassmorphism, zero blue light, WCAG AAA |
| **Landing Page** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | UI design | Calm Entry principle (2 buttons max) |
| **Pricing Page** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | UI design | Free / Pro ($15) / Team ($25) tiers |
| **FOSS Credits** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Content & UI | Open source attribution page |
| **Test Suite** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | Test design | 29 tests across 4 files |
| **Docker & CI/CD** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via Manus) | DevOps | Multi-stage Dockerfile, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions |
| **Logo & Assets** | DALL-E 3 (via Manus) | Image generation | Compass logo, hero background |

## Runtime AI Attribution

The application tracks AI model usage at runtime via the `ai_attribution` database table. Every call to the OpenRouter API logs:

- **Model used** (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`)
- **Component** that made the call (e.g., `email-summarizer`, `commitment-tracker`)
- **Action** performed (e.g., `summarize`, `extract-commitments`)
- **Token usage** (input/output tokens)
- **Latency** (milliseconds)
- **Metadata** (request model vs actual model, finish reason)

This data is accessible via the `trpc.ai.attributions` endpoint and can be viewed in the admin dashboard.

## Model Strengths Observed

| Model | Strengths | Best Used For |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | Architecture, complex logic, accessibility, security | Core business logic, API design, schema design |
| **DALL-E 3** | Visual design, brand assets | Logo, backgrounds, marketing assets |

## Transparency Commitment

Revvel is committed to transparency about AI involvement. Users can:
1. View the AI Attribution page in the app
2. Check the `ai_attribution` table for runtime AI usage
3. Review this document for build-time AI involvement
4. See inline code comments marking AI-generated sections
